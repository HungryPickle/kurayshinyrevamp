The .json files containing the Pokemons you exported will appear here.
To export a Pokemon, you need to have "DEBUG" in the game (complete the base Pokedex to get Magic Boots and DEBUG).
Then go inside your PC storage with DEBUG activated, select one or multiple Pokemons, and press "Export".
Using "Export All" will export all of your Pokemons that are in the PC Storage, INCLUDING the Pokemons from your party.


To re-import a Pokemon, drag its .json file into the "Import" folder, and use the "Import" action in the PC.
Once imported, the file dragged in the "Import" folder will be removed.
You may also import all Pokemons that are placed in the "Import" folder.
If you don't have enough place in your PC storage, the import action will be stopped, and the Pokemons that could be imported will be removed from the "Import" folder, while the Pokemons that didn't get imported will remain in there.
