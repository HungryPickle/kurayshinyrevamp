The .json and .png files containing the Pokemons you exported will appear here.
To export a Pokemon, go inside your PC storage, select one or multiple Pokemons, and press "Export".
Using "Export All" will export all of your Pokemons that are in the PC Storage, INCLUDING the Pokemons from your party.


To re-import a Pokemon, drag its .json and .png files into the "Import" folder, and use the "Import" action in the PC (by selecting a box).

The .png file is optional and a Pokemon can be imported without it. THE .JSON FILE IS MANDATORY

All .json of Pokemons that are in the selected folder from in-game will get imported.
(You can navigate through those folders in ExportedPokemons directly in the game to make your selections)
You may also import one Pokemon randomly by using the "Import Randomly" feature.
Once imported the .json and .png of the Pokemon will be removed by default, you can turn this feature OFF in the options menu.

If you don't have enough place in your PC storage, the import action will be stopped, and the Pokemons that could be imported will be removed from the folder (assuming you didn't turn ON the option that prevent removing the .json/.png files during imports), while the Pokemons that didn't get imported will remain in there.

This ExportedPokemon allows you to import pokemon in your game, to share the Pokemon you exported, to battle those pokemons too (from the PC storage, select a box > select "Battle" > "Battle Randomly from ExportedPokemons folder")
