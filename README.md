# Kuray's PIF Revamp

Kuray's PIF Revamp is a fork of Infinite Fusion, which adds countless new features, including infinite colors for shinies, mods support (people can create mods and load them from a "Mods" folder), a powerful AI (thanks to DemICE), and more!

Kuray's PIF Revamp is community-based and community-focused, it's made by the community, for the community, allowing anyone to easily create new features for Infinite Fusion and to have a better experience overall.
