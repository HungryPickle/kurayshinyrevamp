- A tool that allows you to install all the sprites *(autogen and custom)* from PIF's gitlab servers, so that you can have all the sprites that have been made for the game locally on your computer! Running this tool may take a few hours, please only run it overnight, or when you can let it run for a long time. There's more than 200 000 small sprites involved, so it takes a while to move them and organize them on the computer. You can also manually access those sprites from the gitlab servers yourself by following those links: https://gitlab.com/pokemoninfinitefusion/autogen-fusion-sprites *(autogen)* & https://gitlab.com/pokemoninfinitefusion/customsprites *(custom)* **| by REIZOD**
